        description: 'The Memphis Grizzlies, playing against Rudy Gay for the first time since trading their top scorer to Toronto, scored an 88-82 victory over the Raptors on Wednesday. The Grizzlies (35-18) limited Gay to 13 points, one of his lowest outings since joining Toronto last month, en route to a fifth straight victory that strengthens their bid for homecourt advantage in the playoffs. It was a battle by both teams and eventually it became a game down to the wire, Memphis head coach Lionel Hollins told reporters. We made a lot of plays, got stops, got big rebounds, made plays at the offensive end and also made just enough free throws. Zach Randolph had a team-high 17 points for the Grizzlies, who tightened their grip on fourth place in the NBAs Western Conference and improved on the franchises best start to a season through 53 games. Memphis took a nine-point lead into the final quarter and then had to withstand a fourth-quarter rally by the Raptors (22-33) that was not enough to give the home side their first six-game winning streak since 2009. Alan Anderson came off the Toronto bench to score a game-high 19 points, including four three-pointers during the final quarter as the Raptors tied the game with about four minutes left in regulation. But the Grizzlies prevailed in the end, due in large part to their ability to shut down Gay, who entered the game averaging 21.1 points a game since joining the Raptors. Gay made just five-of-15 attempts, collected a team-high nine rebounds and had a game-high five turnovers.They are not chopped liver defensively, Raptors head coach Dwane Casey told reporters after his team were limited to 36.6 percent shooting in the loss. (Gay) was going to have to work for his shots. Mentally, we have to be ready for that type of fight at the beginning of the game so we get that rhythm early.',

        description: "The Houston Rockets launched into action ahead of the NBA trade deadline by swinging a six-player deal with the Sacramento Kings that sent them last year's number five draft pick Thomas Robinson. Houston, holding the eighth and last Western Conference playoff spot at 30-26, also received forwards Francisco Garcia and Tyler Honeycutt from Sacramento in return for forward Patrick Patterson, center Cole Aldrich and guard Toney Douglas in a trade on Wednesday night. The deal caught Houston players off guard as they were preparing to host last year's conference champion Oklahoma City Thunder. Patterson, Aldrich and Douglas left the arena just as the game got underway. 'It was definitely the weirdest game I've ever played in,' said Houston forward Chandler Parsons. 'It was hard to focus.' The short-handed Rockets rallied from 14 points down to beat the Thunder 122-119 as former Oklahoma City guard James Harden poured in a career-high 46 points.Houston took a gamble on the potential of Robinson, who so far had been a disappointment with the Kings (19-36). The 6-foot-10 Robinson was averaging only 4.8 points and 4.7 rebounds in 16 minutes per game. Patterson was the biggest piece given up by Houston. He had started 38 games this season and was the Houston's fourth-leading scorer, averaging 11.6 points.The NBA trade deadline is 3 p.m. ET on Thursday.",

        description: "Jerry Buss, who parlayed a $1,000 real estate investment into ownership of the Los Angeles Lakers and won 10 National Basketball Association championships, has died at 80, the NBA said on its official website on Monday.Buss had been hospitalized and treated for cancer but the immediate cause of death was kidney failure, according to his assistant, Bob Steiner, who was cited in the NBA post. Buss bought the Lakers in 1979 and under his ownership the team became one of the most valuable and popular franchises in professional sports.The Lakers won league championships during their 'Showtime' era in 1980s and early '90s with teams that feature some of the sports' marquee names, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson. The team had more dominant years in the late 1990s through 2004 with superstars Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal.'The brand of basketball that he brought here with Showtime and the impact that he had on the sport as a whole - those vibrations were felt (by) a kid all the way to Italy at 6 years old before basketball was even global,' said Bryant, who was raised in Italy. Two of Buss' adult children are executive vice presidents of the franchise - Jeanie Buss manages the business and Jim Buss oversees basketball operations. 'This is a sad day for Los Angeles,'' former mayor Richard Riordan tweeted.",

        description: "Yao Ming looks like he could still tangle with Dwight Howard under the basket but the former National Basketball Association number one draft pick clearly has put his playing days in the rear-view mirror.The eight-time Houston Rockets All-Star left the game following the 2010-11 season after the final five years of his career were filled with injuries, most notably to his foot and ankle.'I'm not going to try to come back, I'm not Grant Hill,' he told Reuters with a laugh, referring to the 40-year-old Los Angeles Clippers forward who has returned to the court following a series of career-threatening injuries.'He's unique. He keeps coming back no matter how many surgeries he's had.'' Yao, 32, was a judge for the NBA Slam Dunk Contest on Saturday in the run-up to Sunday's All-Star game, returning to the city where he played since being selected as the number one overall pick in the 2002 NBA Draft.A 7-foot-6 center with soft hands, Yao still works with the NBA, promoting the game in his native China, and owns a team in the Chinese Basketball Association. But he is also involved with his foundation, which helps needy children in the western part of China.The third Chinese to play in the NBA, he is also back in college to complete his degree and lives in Shanghai.Without the injuries that derailed his career, Yao might have ultimately landed a spot in the Basketball Hall of Fame. He was not crushed, however, when he left the game.'If you look at the timeline, I didn't have a career-ending injury,' said Yao. 'I had multiple injuries. The end of my career was something I prepared for. Obviously I still wanted to play but I knew I had to let it go. You know that it's going to end.'Yao, who could still make the Hall of Fame as a contributor, believes there are several players in China that could have a shot at an NBA career.'There are a few young athletes that are pretty talented,' he said. 'I think they have the potential to play in the NBA in the future. It all depends on how they develop.'Yao, who averaged 25 points a game during the 2006-07 season, said he plays basketball 'just a little bit' these days.'Nothing more than HORSE,' a smiling Yao said of the non-contact game, played mostly by children, that involves just shooting.",
